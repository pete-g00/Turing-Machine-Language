This is the repository for my Level 4 Computing (combined) project on Turing Machine Languages (TML). We consider a new approach to learning about Turing Machines by treating it as a programming language and compares it to the standard approach. It is supervised by Ornela Dardha.

The current directory structure is:

* `timelog.md` a log of the time spent on the project.
* `src/` source code for the project.
* `meetings/` minutes with the supervisor.
* `plans/` weekly plans for the project.

More detail will appear as I continue working on the project.

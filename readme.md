This is the repository for my Level 4 Computing (combined) project on Turing Machine Languages (TML). We consider a new approach to learning Turing Machines by treating it as a programming language and compare it to the standard approach. It is supervised by Ornela Dardha.

The directory structure is:

* `dissertation` - the dissertation source code.
* `evaluation` - evaluation worksheet and results.
* `meetings/` - minutes and agendas for meetings with Ornela.
* `plan/` - general project plan.
* `src/` - the source code.
* `timelog.md` - a log of all time spent on the project.

# Evaluating TML
- Evaluating whether it is easier to learn about Turing Machines the traditional way (using the definition/finite state machines) or using the programs.
- There will be a group of students (who aren't familiar with Turing Machines) that are divided into 2 groups: A and B
- There are 3 stages to this: 
    1. learning the relevant content (group A will learn Turing Machines, while group B will learn Turing Machine Language)- this will be like a tutorial
    2. testing their knowledge (writing TMs or TML programs), and seeing how confident they are- this will also be in the tutorial
    3. self-evaluation of their progress- whether they thought the learning process was easy, perhaps they can be shown the other method of learning and see if they believe that would have been easier, etc. This will be an online survey.

To check that the two groups are tested in the same manner, the tests will focus on execution on tape (which is the same in both cases). The first two stages are intertwined to see if there is a difference in how fast the two groups can write programs/draw FSMs.

# Evaluating the TM website
- A survey for user evaluation of the website. Questions to be asked include:
    * are the buttons clear?
    * any visible bugs?
    * is it clear what is happening as you make changes to the code?
    * is the documentation on TML easy to understand and good enough to work with?
- It is expected that those evaluating the site will be familiar with Turing Machines. The main part of this is an online survey, but it might be supplemented with a short meeting before they take the survey.

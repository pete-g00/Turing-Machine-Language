## Part I: Developing TML

### Must Have
- A specification for TML (completed)
- A proof of equivalence between TMs and TMLs (completed)

### Should Have
- Examples of valid programs in the specification (completed; could add more)
- Examples of invalid programs in the specification
- Examples in the proof illustrating the equivalence proof (completed; could add more)

### Could Have
- Connection with the Church-Turing Thesis (in particular lambda-calculus)

## Part II: TML parser, converter to TM and tape executor
### Must Have
- Parsing a string representation of a program to an object representation
- Validating the object representation of a program
- Executing the object representation of a program on a tape

### Should Have
- Converting the object representation of a program to an object representation of a Turing Machine

### Could Have
- Executing an object representation of a Turing Machine on a tape

## Part III: TML Website
- Code the program on the website
- Convert the program to a Turing Machine (FSM)
- Execute the program on a tape

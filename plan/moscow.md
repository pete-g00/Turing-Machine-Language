## Part I: Developing TML

### Must Have
- Specification for TML (completed)
- Proof of equivalence between TMs and TMLs (completed)

### Should Have
- Examples of valid programs in the specification (completed)
- Examples of invalid programs in the specification (completed)
- Examples in the proof illustrating the equivalence proof (completed)

### Could Have
- Connection with the Church-Turing Thesis (in particular lambda-calculus)

## Part II: TML parser, converter to TM and tape executor
### Must Have
- Parsing a string representation of a program to an object representation (completed)
- Validating the object representation of a program (completed)
- Executing the object representation of a program on a tape (completed)

### Should Have
- Converting the object representation of a program to an object representation of a Turing Machine (completed)

### Could Have
- Executing an object representation of a Turing Machine on a tape (completed)

## Part III: TML Website
### Must Have
- Code editor for TML language (completed)
- Convert a program to a FSM representation of a TM (basic positioning of states) (completed)
- Execute a program on a valid tape (completed)

### Should Have
- Syntax highlighting in the code editor (completed)
- Ability to drag the states in the FSM so that they can be better positioned in the frame (removed)

### Could Have
- Error detection in the code editor (completed)
- Configurations (change code editor theme, speed of tape execution, etc.) (completed)
- Programmatically positioning the states so that they are positioned in a visually appealing way (completed)
- Convert a program to its formal representation.

### Will Not Have
- Executing a TM on a valid tape

The project can be roughly divided into 4 parts:

# Part 1- Formalisation of the Turing Machine Program (Language)
A specification of the Turing Machine Program (TMP) will be produced, and it will be shown that this is equivalent to a Turing Machine.

# Part 2- A website that executes a TMP on a tape
An executor for the TMP will be created, and this will be the basis of the website that will allow a user to enter a TMP and execute it on a tape that they define.

# Part 3- The website also converts a TMP to a TM
A converter for the TMP will be created, and this will be the basis of the website that will allow a user to enter a TMP and convert it to a TM.

# Part 4- Evaluation of the new approach
With the help of some volunteers, the approach of teaching the concept of TM will be examined based on both a normal TM and the TMP. The aim is to see whether the volunteers (undergraduate CS students who don't know TMs) will feel more comfortable in TMs after learning about them in a programmatic manner rather than using Finite State Machines. 

Note: the fourth part wasn't part of the proposal and there might not be enough time to complete it.

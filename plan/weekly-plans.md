# Week 3 Plan
The plan for week 3 is to work on the specification of the TML. Originally, I was planning to start working directly on the parser for the language, but I thought it would be better to finalise the language and ensure that we make any tweaks if the working state of TML isn't equivalent to TMs. If there is time, I would also start working on the proof of equivalence between TMs and TML progams.

# Week 4 Plan
The plan for week 4 is to continue working on the proof of equivalence of TMs and TML programs. I have a pretty clear plan on how to proceed, and it should be possible to complete it in a week or two. If there is time to work on other stuff, then I would like to proofread everything and ensure that everything is well-written. It would also be good to get feedback from Ornela and make any tweaks that she deems appropriate.

# Week 5 Plan
The plan for week 5 is to finish the specification and the proof. They are mostly complete, so the aim is just to proofread everything and add more background and make everything concise. I would also like to connect this with Church-Turing Thesis and see what I can do with it. If there is time, I can start looking into the next phase of the project- creating a parser for TML programs. It might be a start to just create an ANTLR .g4 file for it and experiment how to parse and what exactly there is to do. I believe I will have to manually create the parser, and this shouldn't be hard because the language is quite simple.

# Week 3 Plan
The plan for week 3 is to work on the specification of the TML. Originally, I was planning to start working directly on the parser for the language, but I thought it would be better to finalise the language and ensure that we make any tweaks if the working state of TML isn't equivalent to TMs. If there is time, I would also start working on the proof of equivalence between TMs and TML progams.

# Week 4 Plan
The plan for week 4 is to continue working on the proof of equivalence of TMs and TML programs. I have a pretty clear plan on how to proceed, and it should be possible to complete it in a week or two. If there is time to work on other stuff, then I would like to proofread everything and ensure that everything is well-written. It would also be good to get feedback from Ornela and make any tweaks that she deems appropriate.

# Meeting 11-11-22
As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for this meeting.

I am mostly done completing Part 2. I am planning to go back to Part 1 after Part 2 is complete, i.e. writing the proofs in the dissertation. There are no main issues with the project at this point.

Progress has been slow over the last 2 weeks since I have been quite busy with assignments and preparing for an interview! There should be more work completed from next week.


The next meeting will be on the 18th November.

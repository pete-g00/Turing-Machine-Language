# Meeting 02-02-2023

As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for the meeting. I also sent her the evaluation worksheet I had created.

We briefly discussed the state of the website- it is mostly done and just needs final touches to be completed (improving the layout the homepage, adding unit tests and the panel for definition TM). This should be done in the next few weeks.

We mainly talked about the worksheet I had created. Ornela think it looks good, but that the first part might be a bit too difficult- this might make it so that a blank worksheet is because the language is too complex or the students struggled implementing the algorithm. It might be a good idea to give the algorithms in Java (or pseudocode) so that the students are just tested on their use of language and not the actual algorithm. It is also possible that the worksheet takes longer than an hour to complete, and might need to be shortened. It would also be good to change the order of the 3 parts (essentially the opposite). I'm not sure yet if part 2 or 3 should come first, but I totally agree that part 1 should be the last one. I aim to make the relevant changes to the worksheet soon and send it over to Ornela before starting evaluation next week.

The current aim is to run the evaluation on Thursdays and Fridays the next 3 weeks. It will be an hour going through the worksheet in person, followed by a survey which might be possible to complete within the hour, but not necessary. I'm planning to create a Teams page for this which should be sorted tomorrow.

Since the project involves people, I am required to complete an ethics checklist. I will get that done by next Thursday so Ornela can sign it.

Ornela would like us to focus on writing the dissertation during the evaluation phase if the product has been completed. I believe I shall start doing that in 2 weeks time, when the website is completed.

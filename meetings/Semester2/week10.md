This week, we all presented our product in the meeting. I covered:

- the motivation for the project;
- the 3 main objectives (language, parser, website);
- some language design;
- an overview of the parsing process;
- the website structure;
- some evaluation results; and
- some possible future work.

There is no proper meeting next week as it is quite close to the deadline, but we should let Ornela know the status of the project during the week!

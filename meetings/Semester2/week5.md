# Meeting 02-02-2023

As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for the meeting. I also sent her the evaluation worksheet I had created.

We discussed the state of the website- I have now added code execution to the website (except for highlighting code). I should be done with the website by next week- I just need to add the definition panel for TM and highlighting code. Ornela said this is all great!

We also discussed the evaluation survey I created- Ornela said it is looking fine. Ornela doesn't think there's anything to add to the survey.

Evaluation starts tomorrow and Ornela is fine with it!

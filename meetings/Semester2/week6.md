# Meeting 16-02-2023

As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for the meeting.

We discussed the evaluation- it has been quite successful. I am glad that I have decided to have it in-person instead of having it online; I was able to observe a bunch of bugs the website had that I hadn't even thought about! The first session was unfortunately longer than an hour, but I have now made some changes to the worksheet so that it fits within an hour. Currently, 7 people have completed the worksheet/survey, and I'm hoping to get about 20 in total. I believe I have about 15/16 sign-ups. It should be completed by the end of next week.

We also discussed the state of the website- all the features I want to implement are now completed; any changes I will now make shall only fix bugs. The final feature I added, along with tests, was the ability to convert a program into a definition representation of a TM. I demonstrated this during the meeting, and Ornela said she is quite happy with it!

From next week, I shall be focusing on the dissertation. I aim to complete requirements next week (I expect to be quite busy with evaluation, so only that), and then I shall work on other stuff from the week after.

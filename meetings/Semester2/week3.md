# Meeting 26-01-2023

As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for the meeting.

I explained that I had mostly completed the website. The documentation should be completed by the next week. There are some other stuff left to complete such as the definition of the Turing Machine, testing and the optimising FSM presentation. I will continue on working on these, but at a lower rate from next week, also giving time to the evaluation.

We mostly discussed evaluation in the meeting. Ornela wasn't sure last week about the way I was planning the evaluation, so I sent her a document explaining all the components to it. There are 2 things to evaluate- the Turing Machine Language and the website (user evaluation). After the previous discussions with Ornela, I believe it is best to run both parts of evaluation with the same cohort- second year students. They are considered the best candidates since they have had sufficient experience in programming, but have not yet been exposed to Turing Machines. I plan to start recruiting them from next week to complete the evaluation by the end of February, which is when Ornela would like it to be completed. I will also start working on the worksheets that will be used as part of evaluation- there will be 2- one going through Turing Machines and the other going through Turing Machine Language. It is expected that the website evaluation is later, closer to mid February if not the final week.

We are strongly recommended to use Microsoft Forms instead of Google Forms- the uni doesn't like Google forms for some reason! It is also good to collect extra metadata about the users, e.g. their familiarity and confidence with coding.

The next meeting will be next Thursday.

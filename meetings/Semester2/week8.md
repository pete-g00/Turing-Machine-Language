# Meeting 02-03-2023

As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for the meeting.

This week, I had written up evaluation and future work sections in the dissertation. I went through that with Ornela, and she said that it looks mostly good. The one main issue is that the text is quite dense- it might be a good idea to break it into shorter paragraphs or to use styling to highlight important parts. This should be an easy fix. Ornela would also like me to change the name "website" to "tool" or "product". I will add a concluding paragraph to summarise conclusion. 

It might also be a good idea to make the evaluation section longer; I have spent a lot of time working on the evaluation and this should be reflected! I should certainly add a concluding paragraph that summarises the results and the future work possible to be done.

# Week 3 Meeting Agenda (07-10-2022)

## Work Completed This Week
- Started and finished the specification for the Turing Machine Language (TML).
- Started the proof of equivalence between TMs and TML programs.

## Work To Complete Next Week
- Finish the equivalence between TMs and TML programs.
- Proofread everything and ensure it is correct.

## Questions
- Would be good to get feedback on the specification- is it missing anything; would it be good to include more examples (e.g. an incorrect program)?
- Is the plan for equivalence good- convert a valid TML program into a "complete" TML program, which is more detailed and much simpler to convert to a TM, and then show that it is possible to convert a TM into a (complete) TML program?

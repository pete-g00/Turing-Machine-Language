# Week 4 Meeting Agenda (14-10-2022)

## Work Completed This Week
- Finished the proof of equivalence between TMs and TML (Turing Machine Language) programs.
- Added some examples in the document.
- Started MoSCoWs for the project- completed it for the TML part.

## Work To Complete Next Week
- Add background/motivation to the specification?
- Proofread the two documents.
- Start working on the parser.

## Questions
- What would be a good reference for the definition of TMs and tape execution- the book for Algs I (Algorithm Design by Goodrich & Tamassia) might be a good place to find it
- Would it be good to add some background information on TMs as well to the specification/proof? And maybe some motivation on TML as well
- I'm not totally sure what to look into for connection to lambda-calculus. What would be a good place to start working on it?

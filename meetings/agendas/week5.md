# Week 5 Agenda

## Work Completed This Week
- Finished working on the specification and proof of equivalence- combined them to a single document (called documentation), and made some changes after proofreading
- Expanded the MoSCoWs for Part II- the parser
- Started working on the parser- created a class to parse the code given as string and return every (non-comment) token one at a time, along with its position (with unit testing and linting, supported by github CI)

## Work To Complete Next Week
- Continue working on the parser:
    * complete the parsing of the program into contexts; 
    * work on the validator (check the parser program is a valid TML program); 
    * work on the converter for a valid program, etc.

## Questions
- Would be good if Ornela could have a look at the documentation and give me some feedback
- Is the plan for the parser good- would you want me to do anything differently?

# Week 9 Agenda

## Work Completed This Week
* Added motivation and objectives
* Changed the language content previously present- added language design; moved the previous content to the appendix
* Added parser background
* Added parser design
* Started parser implementation

## Work to Complete Next Week
* Finish parser implementation
* Complete product design and implementation

## Questions
* Is the language design right? I feel like the previous content was closer to the source code instead of the design. This feels more like what should be the design of the language. 
* Design and implementation balance in parser- there's some stuff that I feel like could go in either section, e.g. the design pattern stuff. Is it the right balance right now? Would you want me to move any of the content around?
* Overall, is the dissertation turning out fine? I have not proof read much and will be doing that on Thursday and Friday so it might have many mistakes currently. But, is it generally looking good?

# Week 11 Agenda

## Work Completed This Week
* Finished Part 2- updated the visitor classes and made use of a pedantic linter
* Reorganised dissertation containing Part 1 content- moved some content to design and appendix
* Updated MoSCoWs expanding on Part 3

## Work to Complete Next Week
* Start working on Part 3- create a basic website that implements the 3 main features (code editor, TM conversion and tape execution). Try out different frameworks and choose APIs to help with this process.

## Questions
* How is the dissertation structure now? I have kept the TM stuff in background and everything else is in design/appendix.
* What about content in the dissertation? Are the proofs/examples alright?
* Is the MoSCoW fine? Is there something I have missed on Part 3 content?

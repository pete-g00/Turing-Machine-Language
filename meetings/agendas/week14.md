# Week 14 Agenda

## Work Completed This Week (and final week of Sem 1)
* Changed the syntax of TML using Mate's feedback- I had made 2 changes to the code, making one of them redundant!
* Connected the TM Panel with the current TM code
* Improved dragging arrow in the FSM (looks more smooth and is at the `right' position)

## Work to Complete Next Week
* Connect the Tape Panel with the current TM code

## Questions
* The plan is to add two buttons to the website so that we can convert to both FSM and actual definition- does that sound good?

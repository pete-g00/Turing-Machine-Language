# Meeting 18-11-22
As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for this meeting. 

I have completed almost finished Part 2- next week I shall complete the code executor and that completes the must haves and the should haves of Part 2. I'm planning to continue working on Part 2 for one more week, and try to complete the following:

1. creating the executor for TM programs
2. creating the executor for TMs
3. changing the way the visitor classes are currently present so that the methods not being used are removed

The first task must be completed. The second task is not necessary but can be completed if there is time. We discussed the third task in some detail- I thought removing the redundant methods by not adhering to visitor classes, but Ornela argued that using a visitor design pattern makes the classes uniform. We decided that I could work on the third task if there is time, and there is always a possibility to revert back to the current form of code.

The next meeting will be in two weeks- we won't have a meeting next week, but we should sent our agenda nonetheless. These meetings will also be online. We should send Ornela the status report by the 9th December.

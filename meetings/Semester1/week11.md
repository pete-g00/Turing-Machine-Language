# Meeting 02-12-22

As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for this meeting.

At this point, I have finished working on Part 2 of the project, Part 3 has been planned (i.e. the moscow has been updated) and I went back to change Part 1.

Ornela said that the moscow is looking fine. The structure of the dissertation however is still confusing. Although the background section is now better placed with TM content (and will have more stuff on parsers, the frameworks I use, etc.), the design and implementation sections aren't. It just doesn't work for the project I have. Hence, Ornela suggested that I have the equivalent of design and implementation for each of the 3 parts of the project. I believe this would be as follows:


* A chapter on Part 1 -> the documentation and the specification of TML, along with proof of equivalence.
* A chapter on Part 2 -> design of the parser and the structure of the code, along with its implementation.
* A chapter on Part 3 -> design of the website and its implementation.

It might be possible to group Parts 2 and 3 together, but currently I shall be focusing only on Part 1.

Next week, we start the crunch period meaning that I would be expected to work about 20 hours on the project the next week and the week after. Also, the status report is due the next meeting (instead of an agenda). Ornela would also like us to demo our project- I will go through some of the proofs, the parser and the basic website that I will have constructed by the end of next week. We will be meeting on the Friday online.

# Meeting 07-10-2022
As requested by Ornela, I sent her the agenda for this meeting. I had sent her two documents this week- the proof of equivalence and the moscows. The MoSCoWs are incomplete currently- I have only completed the MoSCoW for the first subpart that I am working on. 

In terms of the MoSCoWs, Ornela said that it would not be a good idea to include dissertation-specific stuff, e.g. evaluation and background research. This is about the product of the project, which is mainly the website, and for the website the TML must be defined.

In terms of the proof, Ornela had a look at the main theorems- equivalence between:

* complete TML programs and TMs;
* TMs and complete TML programs; and
* valid TML programs and complete TML programs.

Ornela would like me to add more detail to the proof and structure them more concretely, e.g. make the induction value clear, use bullet points for each cases. She will validate the proof when I make these changes and send it to her next week.

Ornela also said that it might be a bit of an overkill the way I am working on some the content, e.g. the specification and the proof having an abstract, the moscows broken down into each subpart. I'll take this into consideration in future- I'm planning to combine both the documents and insert it directly to the dissertation, and abandon the subpart division with the MoSCoWs. Ornela also stated that, although the evaluation of TML in general sounds great, it should not be part of the MoSCoW- again, this focuses more in the dissertation.

I asked Ornela what would be a good reference for Turing Machine content. This was discussed in last year's course Algorithmics I, so it might be good to ask the lecturer (Gethin) about it. I had a look at the book from the course, but couldn't find it there. It is not a priority to find the reference just yet, but will be required for the dissertation.

The plan for the next week is to finish working on the specification/proof and move onto the parser. One main thing I can have a look into, which was mentioned last week, is the Church-Turing Thesis. Ornela believes this would be a great addition to the document- it would complete the cycle; from lambda-calculus (a programming language), to turing machines, and back to a form of programming language. This sounds great, but there might not be time to do so the next week. I'll prioritise proofreading and correctness over this, and will try to come back to it at the end.

Because the main aim of the project is a website, I think writing the parser in typescript would be a good idea. This keeps the project quite flexible and allows me to try out different frameworks/available APIs and see which one works out best for the project.

We will not have a normal meeting next week- Ornela is quite busy. We have decided to have an online meeting on Tuesday 25 October, circa 2pm. The next normal meeting will be Friday 11 November. We should still send Ornela agendas every week and ask her any burning questions as we see fit.

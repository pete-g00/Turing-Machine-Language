# Week 2 Meeting- 30th September 2022

Ornela is supervising 6 L4/MSci students, so we have agreed to meet as a team on Fridays to discuss our projects. We started by introducing each other. 

From next week, Ornela would like us to send the following before each meeting:

* An agenda for the meeting, including any (non-urgent) questions that we would like her to answer about the project; we can also contact her at a different time if we need an urgent answer.
* The progress we made over the week.
* The plan we have for the next week.

This does not need to be very detailed, but it should be enough for her to gauge that we have made enough progress over the week/have a robust plan for the next week.

The first course of action should be to break the project down into multiple tasks- later, if we realise we cannot complete everything, this would allow us to still produce a valuable product.

When it comes to evaluation, in my case, I should have (unit) tests to test my code. It would also be good to have some sort of user evaluation. Ornela suggested that I could ask the students who have taken the course Algorithmics I to evaluate the website. I suggested we can expand this and compare how the students find learning about Turing Machines through finite state machines and through a programming language, which they might be more comfortable with.

We will aim to meet on Fridays every week- everyone has said they can meet on Fridays. So, the next meeting with be 7th October.

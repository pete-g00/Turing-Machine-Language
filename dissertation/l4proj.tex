\title{Turing Machine Language} 
\author{Pete Gautam}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    % Turing Machines are a model of computation that is taught to students formally 
    Turing Machines are taught to students who have some experience in programming. This is typically done in a diagrammatic or a mathematical manner. This projects defines a programming language for Turing Machines and investigates if it is easier for them to grasp the concepts using programming or diagrams. It was found that the language was somewhat easier for students to learn than the diagrammatic approach.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Ornela for all the support she provided throughout the semester. Also, I am grateful for everyone who participated in the evaluation sessions- committing one hour in person was a big thing to ask and I am glad so many came along!

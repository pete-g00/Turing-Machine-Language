\title{Turing Machine Language} 
\author{Pete Gautam}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Turing Machines are a model of computation that is typically taught to computing students after some years of coding experience. This is mostly done using finite state machines or the formal definition. It is a topic that students have struggled to learn due to its theoretical nature. This projects presents a programming language for Turing Machines along with a website to showcase it. It was found that the language is a good intermediate when constructing TMs.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Ornela for all the support she provided throughout the semester. Also, I am grateful for everyone who participated in the evaluation sessions- committing one hour was a big thing to ask and I am glad so many came along!

\begin{abstract}
    % Every abstract follows a similar pattern. Motivate; set aims; describe work; explain results.
    % \vskip 0.5em
    % ``XYZ is bad. This project investigated ABC to determine if it was better. 
    % ABC used XXX and YYY to implement ZZZ. This is particularly interesting as XXX and YYY have
    % never been used together. It was found that  
    % ABC was 20\% better than XYZ, though it caused rabies in half of subjects.''

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. 

% PAGE LIMITS
% You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. 
% This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but *excluding the appendices and bibliography*.
%
% FORMATTING
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
% Do not alter the bibliography style. 
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings and structure here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.  If in doubt, your supervisor can give you specific guidance; their view takes precedence over
% the structure suggested here.

% Why should the reader care about what are you doing and what are you actually doing?
% \section{Guidance}

% \textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly. 

% \section{Writing guidance}
% \subsection{Who is the reader?}

% This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%     is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
%     \item
%     has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
%     \item
%     has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
%     \item
%     might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
%     \emph{explain your project}.
%     \item
%     but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
%     strive for accuracy.}
%     \item
%     doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
%     irrelevant}.
% \end{itemize}

% Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
% of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
% committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

% \subsection{References and style guides}
% There are many style guides on good English writing. You don't need to
% read these, but they will improve how you write.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%     \emph{How to write a great research paper} \cite{Pey17} (\textbf{recommended}, even though you aren't writing a research paper)
%     \item
%     \emph{How to Write with Style} \cite{Von80}. Short and easy to read. Available online.
%     \item
%     \emph{Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace} \cite{Wil09} A very popular modern English style guide.
%     \item
%     \emph{Politics and the English Language} \cite{Orw68}  A famous essay on effective, clear writing in English.
%     \item
%     \emph{The Elements of Style} \cite{StrWhi07} Outdated, and American, but a classic.
%     \item
%     \emph{The Sense of Style} \cite{Pin15} Excellent, though quite in-depth.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Citation styles}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item If you are referring to a reference as a noun, then cite it as: ``\citet{Orw68} discusses the role of language in political thought.''
% \item If you are referring implicitly to references, use: ``There are many good books on writing \citep{Orw68, Wil09, Pin15}.''
% \end{itemize}

% There is a complete guide on good citation practice by Peter Coxhead available here: \url{http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxc/refs/index.html}. 
% If you are unsure about how to cite online sources, please see \citet{UNSWWebsite}. 
% \footnote{Specifying an online resource like \url{https://developer.android.com/studio}
% in a footnote sometimes makes more sense than including it as a formal reference.}

% \subsection{Plagiarism warning}

% \begin{highlight_title}{WARNING}
    
%     If you include material from other sources without full and correct attribution, you are commiting plagiarism. The penalties for plagiarism are severe.
%     Quote any included text and cite it correctly. Cite all images, figures, etc. clearly in the caption of the figure.
% \end{highlight_title}

% \subsection{Quoting text}

% If you are quoting a long passage, use a \texttt{quote} environment:

% \begin{quote}
%      If you scribble your thoughts any which way, your readers will surely feel that you care nothing about them. They will mark you down as an egomaniac or a chowderhead -or, worse, they will stop reading you. The most damning revelation you can make about yourself is that you do not know what is interesting and what is not.
% \end{quote} \citep{Von80}

% If you are quoting inline, like Simon Peyton-Jones' following remark, use quotation marks ``Conveying the intuition is primary, not
% secondary'' \citep{Pey17}.

% What did you do to implement this idea, and what technical achievements did you make?
% \section{Guidance}
% You can't talk about everything. Cover the high level first, then cover important, relevant or impressive details.

% \section{General guidance for technical writing}

% These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.

% \subsection{Figures}
% \emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
% You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.


% Figures are important. Use them well.
% \begin{figure}[htb]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/relu.pdf}    

%     \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
%     $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
%     ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
%     \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.
%     }

%     % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
%     \label{fig:relu} 
% \end{figure}


% \begin{figure}[htb] 
%     \centering

%     \caption{Synthetic test images for edge detection algorithms. \subref{fig:syn1} shows various gray levels that require an adaptive algorithm. \subref{fig:syn2}
%     shows more challenging edge detection tests that have crossing lines. Fusing these into full segments typically requires algorithms like the Hough transform.
%     This is an example of using subfigures, with \texttt{subref}s in the caption.
%     }\label{fig:synthetic}
% \end{figure}

% \subsection{Equations}

% Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
% (the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

% For example, we might define:
% \begin{equation}
%     \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
% \end{equation}    
% where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

% \subsection{Algorithms}
% Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% % NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
% \begin{algorithm}
%     \DontPrintSemicolon
%     \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
%     $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
%     \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
%     \Begin{
%         $s \longleftarrow []$\;
%         $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
%         $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
%         \While{$i < n$}
%         {
%             $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
%             $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
%             $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
%             $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
%             \If{$r<a$}
%             {
%                 $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
%                 $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
%                 $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
%                 append $x$ to $s$\;
%             }
%         }
%     }

% specialised for normal proposal distributions $q(x^\prime|x) = \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$. The symmetry of the normal distribution means the acceptance rule takes the simplified form.}\label{alg:metropolis}
% \end{algorithm}

% \subsection{Tables}

% If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
% extremely tedious otherwise. 

% \begin{table}[]
